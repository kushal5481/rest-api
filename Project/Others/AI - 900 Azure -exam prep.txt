AI - 9000 Azure -exam prep

Azure cognitive services  - pre trained model
------------------------

get intelligence from text, images, audio, video


Without Needing data scientists- build simple 
-------------------------------
models

limited/no code experience

example: custom vision

example azure machine leaning
automated machine learning


Using data scientists and team - Build complex 
-----------------------------
model

build your own ml module from zero(code-experienced)

example: using azure machine learning


strong ai and narrow ai machine learning and traditional programming

azure cognitive services -> pre-trained model

azure machine learning(automated machine learning), custom vision ->                 

building simple model without needing data scientists or AI/ML skills

complex ml models -> azure machine learning

Pre - trained model- cognitive services
---------------------------------
this services bring ai with reach of every developer

AI without building custom models

does not need machine-learning expertise

exposed as API

------------------------------------------

HELP PROGRAMS see , hear , speak , search understand like humans

	Get intelligence from:
images/videos: computer vision, face api. form recognizer

text: text analytivd, translator text, trxt to speech api

audio speech to text API. LUIS -Lang understanding intelligent service- LUIS

Other
conversations
anamaly detector services


cognitive service renamamed azure ai service search

custom vision is renamed to azure ai vision

face service is renamed to azure ai face detection

form recognizer is now azure ai document intelligence

speech service is now azure ai speech service

translator service is now azure ai translator service
-----------------------------




cognitive service azure ai search
-----------------------------

exploring vision related apis

vision- computer vision

analyze and describe images
read text in imagery

read handwriting in imagery
recognize celebrities and landmarks

identifiy objects and detecting objects and tags 


videos as input - identifying appears of the video

sam George

key topic of videos

sentiment

sentiment changes throughout the videos 

key annotations

transciptions

importent some more API
----------------------------------------

face api -
custom vision
----------------------------------------

exploring vision - some technology

image analysis - extract tags from images

image classification - classify image into different groups

object detection - identify object in image

class of object, confident level, coordinates of bouding box
goes deepper than image classification


face detection: detect human faces 
face detection and analysis: security, tag friends on facebook, identity validation

optical character recognition(OCR)- LICENCE PLATES, INVOICE
----------------------------------------------------------------
Computer vision api
----------------
analisye image - can you describe image , can you categorize the image
what is there in the image -> object/tagd/faces/celebrities/monuments with box co-ordinates
type of images-> clip art/line drawing
color scheme is used in image
image have mature content
--------------------------------------------------------------------
describe image -> description and caption detect object -> performing object detection on the specified image


get area of interest -> impoertent area in the image
get read result
get thumbnail -> generate a thumbnail image
list domain specific models
OCR
Read
recognize domain specific content -> identify celebrities, landmarks
tag image-> generates a list of words or tags relevant to images
-----------------------------------------------------------------
simple ocr ( detects text in an image)
quick extraction of  small amounts of text( immediate results)

results: line > words (each with bouding box coordinates)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------

read: perform OCR on complex documents

optimized for text-heavy images or multi-page documents or documents with multiple languages

executes asynchronously
--------------------------

additional call to get the result

results: pages>lines>words(each with bouding box coordinates)

-----------------------------------------------------
https://portal.vision.cognitive.azure.com/demo/face-detection

----------------------------------------------------------
Getting started with Face API
----------------------------------------------------------

advanced face detection
age , emotions, glasses. hair, makeup

detect human faces, find similar faces, match face with a group

accuracy need to improve for face identification

quality of images
variety of images

-----------------------------------------------------------------

important concepts:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

facelist( upto 1k faces) & largefacelist(upto 1m faces)


Face API
--------
Detect 
find similar
group
identify
verify
-----------------------------------------
form recognizer is now document inteleigent

operations over odf or images

analyze ID doc analyze invoice
, analuze receipt

custom form: design and extract key value pairs, tables and semantic values from custom documents- pdf or images


------------------------------
scenario and solution
------------------------------
divide candidate faces (3-1000) into groups based on face similarity -- group

recommend face api find closest matches of the specific query person face in a group - identify

face api operation: do two faces belongs to same person - verify

face belongs to the specific person or not -> verify

language: extract meaning from unstructured text

text analytics-> detect sentiment key phrases and named entites

translator -> translate to/from 90 languages

speech: integrate speech into apps and services

speech service: speech to text , text to
speech, translation and speaker recognition

build conversation:
QnA maker conversational question and answer
LUIS-> language understanding intelligent service




------------------------------------------------
text analysis
----------------------------------------------
a text-minig AI service that uncovers insights such as sentiment analysis, entities, relations and key phrases in unstructured text
--------------------------

sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction and language detection

operations:
detect language

language name

entinites containing personal information: return a list of entities with personal information(SSN , Bank account etc) in the document

key phrases: returns a list of string denoting the key phrases

named entity recognition: list of general named enities in a given document


sentiment:details sentiment analysis


----------------------------------

translator text API: Text to text translation
